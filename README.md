# Qualitative-analyse-software-project
C# rich text editor with qualitative analysis capabilities

## Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to build a rich text editor that has capabilities for qualitative analysis. The minimal product should therefore include an easy to use text-editor, a way to import text files, being able to edit the imported text files, and tag the text within those files. The tagges should be able to be grouped and moved within a tag 'tree'. Finally, I should be able to search the text based on the tags and easily browse through them, including being able to export the analysis to Excel. 

## Reasons for this project
For my job, I regularly analyze interview transcripts, but we don't have a license for any qualitative analysis software. And the open-source software that is available is either way too complex or way too old. So, being fed-up, with the lack of available software, I decided to make a program myself, and I hope to learn a lot along the way. The final product should be easy to use, good-looking (though kind of basic) qualitative analysis software, with which you can easily analyze interview transcripts (or other text docs).
